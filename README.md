# JS-Hangman-Game
Simple game with pure Javascript

This is a simple game in which you can find out movie titles. For creating the task I used The Movie DB API. 
The purpose of this project was to practice my JS skills. It contains many array functions, an AJAX request, asyn/await and arrow functions; and many DOM interaction, that I do not really like, but since it's a game, it has to provide a certain level of interactivity.
